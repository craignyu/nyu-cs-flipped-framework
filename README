Customizing the system:
=====================================================================

--------------------
Modules/Submodules:
--------------------
This system is composed of modules and submodules.

Each page of the site is considered a module.  A module contains a list of
submodules to include.  Each module adds the necessary submodules and inserts 
the content into the main body of the page.

--------------------
Creating a module
--------------------
- Copy the template module "module_demo.php" to a new module name.
- Update your new module with whatever submodules and text you want it to use.
- Add your new module link to the "menu.txt" list.

--------------------
Changing submodules in a module
--------------------
Open up the associated module##.php file.  Update the $submodules array to
include a list of submodules to include.  Also update the $submodules_text
array to include human-readable labels for each module.

--------------------
Creating a submodule
--------------------
- Duplicate the "submodules/submodule01" directory
- A submodule is comprised of a single file named 'content.txt' which contains
  all HTML content that you want to display to your students for a particular
  topic
- You can also include images and other forms of media in a submodule directory

--------------------
Creating a video
--------------------
- You can use any video recording & editing program that you wish to use
- We recommend hosting your videos on YouTube under an unlisted channel
- Ensure that your video is set up with closed captions (YouTube will create
  basic captions for you automatically)
- Once a video has been uploaded to YouTube you can copy the "embed code" 
  (found under the 'share' menu) into your 'content.txt'' file for your module.
